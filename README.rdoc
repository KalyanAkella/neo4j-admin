== What

Starts a webserver using an embedded neo4j graph database.

== Why

Because we need to admin and visualize the graph database

== How

Using the neo4j server jars to start up an jetty web server.

Starts up a jetty web server.

== Usage

It should be possible to use this from a rails project. Maybe as an initializer, or is there a better way ?


I also want it to work standalone:

  neo4j-admin <storage_path>

== Status

Not ready to be used !
It should be available as a gem.
